<p> Before learning from this module, I had no experience with web development or coding. 
To be honest, getting used to it was difficult for me at first. But, with time, I managed to grasp the fundamentals. 
My friends and teacher were also really helpful and nice to me. All of my doubts were dispelled. 
My buddies were similarly new to everything, but despite our inexperience, 
we shared what little information we had and held discussion sessions after our lectures. 
Our teacher was also quite helpful. He made it a point to clarify any misunderstandings we had.</p>
<p> So we got our assignments after a few weeks. As a result, this was also new to us. 
Our teacher informed us of the assignment, but because it was unfamiliar territory for us, 
we initially misunderstood the job. So we went home and looked at our assignments' briefs.
 Later, we went to our classrooms and cleared out all of our misunderstandings one by one. 
 So, at first, we did things our own way since we didn't know what to do.
 We later discovered that this was not the case, so we made some modifications, which are detailed below.</p>

<p> For the css and html, I used what I learnt in the lectures, and for other pages,
 I used resources from the internet, which I will list below. For this project, 
 I utilized whatever CSS I knew and had studied in lectures. 
 And whatever would be the most simple and straightforward way for me to do this task. 
 And, when it came to the designs, I kept everything as simple as feasible and user-friendly because it was my first time. 
 I chose some colors at random that I thought would look beautiful in my perspective. That's all there is to it. 
 It was enjoyable to do so, but it was also stressful because we were studying for our examinations at the same time. 
 As a result, it was difficult to concentrate on just one item.</p>
