<h3> day 1</h3>
 <p>i have just started my assignment. well first i had a look at assignment brief. Well 
to be honest i dont know how to do it or how to start it.Well i will just start it roughly. 
so i completed my first page and have updated it in my github.Its not that good but i have 
just started , might make changes later.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
 <p>today our teachers gave more brief of our assignment.I had some of my confusions cleared. 
but honestly its a lot for me to process this. my second task is to create a portfolio html 
. So i am doing everything i have learned and also with that i am taking help from internet 
too. Well all this referncing and assignments thing is new to me .So to make it little  
easy for me , i am planning to complete all the task first and later i will have the look at the 
referencing and the restrictions we were given.</p>
